Prompt:
Please generate a piece of Structured Text (ST) code that complies with the IEC 61131-3 standard and is specifically compatible with OpenPLC Runtime 3. Ensure that the code adheres to the following requirements and guidelines:
1. Global and External Variable Definitions
Define all global variables using VAR_GLOBAL within a CONFIGURATION block to comply with OpenPLC Runtime 3's variable scope requirements.
In each PROGRAM and FUNCTION block, reference the global variables using VAR_EXTERNAL to maintain proper variable scope and adherence to the runtime's standard practices.
2. Variable Declaration Positioning
Global variables must only be declared within the CONFIGURATION block and referenced via VAR_EXTERNAL in PROGRAM and FUNCTION blocks. Do not declare global variables outside of these specific contexts.
Ensure all variables are declared within the appropriate blocks and that their scope is clearly defined.
3. Comments and Parsing Considerations
Use comments carefully to avoid potential parsing issues during compilation in OpenPLC Runtime 3. Ensure comments are placed in a way that does not disrupt the logic of the code.
Use standard comment formats (* ... *) for multi-line comments and // for single-line comments. Ensure comments do not inadvertently interfere with compilation or execution.
4. Syntax Consistency and Naming Conventions
Follow OpenPLC Runtime 3's specific syntax rules strictly, including proper variable naming, referencing, and input/output declarations. Improper syntax or formatting can lead to compilation errors.
If encountering syntax errors such as "unknown syntax error," ensure that all code structures, such as VAR, VAR_GLOBAL, VAR_EXTERNAL, and related blocks, are formatted correctly and aligned with OpenPLC Runtime 3's expected syntax.
5. Code Structure and Block Organization
Adhere to OpenPLC Runtime 3's structural requirements for CONFIGURATION, PROGRAM, TASK, and FUNCTION blocks. Proper organization and sequencing of these blocks are essential for successful compilation.
Maintain logical hierarchy and organization of blocks, ensuring all elements are placed correctly according to the standard.
6. Error Handling and Persistent Issues
If compilation issues persist despite multiple attempts at correction, review the code structure, variable scope definitions, and block arrangements to ensure full compliance with OpenPLC Runtime 3's standards.
Include basic error-handling mechanisms and logging capabilities to assist with debugging and provide feedback on code execution states.
7. Example Code
Provide an example of code that adheres to these requirements:
plaintext


CONFIGURATION MyConfig
VAR_GLOBAL
    globalVar1 : BOOL; // Example global variable
END_VAR
RESOURCE MyResource ON PLC
    TASK mainTask(INTERVAL := T#20ms, PRIORITY := 0);
    PROGRAM MyProgram WITH mainTask : PLC_PRG;
END_RESOURCE
END_CONFIGURATION

PROGRAM PLC_PRG
VAR_EXTERNAL
    globalVar1 : BOOL; // Referencing global variable
END_VAR

(* Toggle the global variable based on a condition *)
IF globalVar1 THEN
    globalVar1 := FALSE; // Simple toggle logic
ELSE
    globalVar1 := TRUE;
END_IF

END_PROGRAM
8. Output Format
The generated code must follow all specified guidelines and be compatible with OpenPLC Runtime 3. Include structured comments to describe the functionality, ensuring that all block structures, variable definitions, and references comply with the IEC 61131-3 standard. Provide clear explanations using appropriate comment syntax within the code where necessary.Prompt:
